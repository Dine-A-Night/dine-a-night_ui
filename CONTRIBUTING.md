## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/Amnish04/til-page-builder/blob/master/README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/Amnish04/til-page-builder/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/Amnish04/til-page-builder/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (@angular, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

<!--
You might want to create a separate issue tag for questions and include it in this description. People should then tag their issues accordingly.

Depending on how large the project is, you may want to outsource the questioning, e.g. to Stack Overflow or Gitter. You may add additional contact and information possibilities:
- IRC
- Slack
- Gitter
- Stack Overflow tag
- Blog
- FAQ
- Roadmap
- E-Mail List
- Forum
-->

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://github.com/Amnish04/til-page-builder/blob/master/README.md). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <amnishsingh04@gmail.com>.

<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/Amnish04/til-page-builder/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for til-page-builder, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/Amnish04/til-page-builder/blob/master/README.md) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/Amnish04/til-page-builder/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Amnish04/til-page-builder/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most til-page-builder users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for enhancement suggestions that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

### Your First Code Contribution

The UI for Dine-A-Night is written in [Angular](https://angular.io/) and it interacts with various cloud services like [Google Maps Platform](https://mapsplatform.google.com/), and [Firebase Services](https://firebase.google.com/) like [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start?authuser=0&hl=en) and [Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/start?authuser=0&hl=en) in addition to our own [Backend](https://github.com/Dine-A-Night/dine-a-night_api).
For most of the above-mentioned services, their Angular **wrapper packages** were used instead of the official SDKs provided by respective Service Providers.

#### Installing Dependencies 💻

There is no need to install these packages manually as the package.json file can do it for us with a simple command of:

```
npm install
```

However, here’s a list of all the external packages installed except the ones scaffolded with a new Angular Project.

**Dependencies:**

```
"ag-grid-angular": "^31.2.0", (The God Grid 😎)
"@angular/fire": "^16.0.0", (Firebase SDK wrapper for Angular)
"@angular/google-maps": "^16.2.14", (For google maps and Places Autocomplete)
"@angular/material": "^16.2.13", (Component Library)
"@angular/cdk": "^16.2.13", (For Drag and Drop)
"firebase": "^10.7.2",
"luxon": "^3.4.4", (For working with dates)
"ngx-material-timepicker": "^13.1.1", (Timepicker Component)
"uuid": "^9.0.1", (For generating random UUIDs)
```

**Dev Dependencies:**

```
"@types/firebase": "^3.2.1"
"husky": "^9.0.6",
"lint-staged": "^15.2.0",
"prettier": "3.2.4",
"tailwindcss": "^3.4.1",
```

You’ll notice that several static analysis tools have also been used for maintaining **high code quality** and **consistent standards** even with multiple contributors.
For example, [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) and [Lint-Staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) for setting up **pre-commit hooks** that automatically format code in staged files before each commit.
You can check out [this post](https://medium.com/@bkn020612/using-eslint-husky-lint-staged-6d6609b02fc2) to learn more about pre-commit hooks and how you can even set up ESLint for enforcing coding standards.

The entire **dependency graph** can be found [here](https://github.com/Dine-A-Night/dine-a-night_ui/network/dependents).

#### Running the Application

Once the required dependencies have been installed, you can simply run the following command to run a local development server.

```
ng serve --open
```

or

```
npm start
```

![Landing Page](/src/assets/doc-images/image.png)

#### Enabling Google Maps

You will notice that any features involving Google Maps will not function correctly since the API Key setup in environment files only allow requests from Dine-A-Night's production domain.

In order to work on those features locally, you will have to get your own **Google Maps Key**, which can be generated like so.

1. Visit https://mapsplatform.google.com/ and click “Get Started”.

![GoogleMapsPlatform](/src/assets/doc-images/GoogleMapsPlatform.png)

2. Once signed in, you will be taken to Google Cloud Console. Open the **Project Selection** menu.

![ProjectSelection](/src/assets/doc-images/ProjectSelection.png)

3. Click on **New Project** and fill the required details.

![NewProject](/src/assets/doc-images/NewProject.png)

4. Once your project is created, go to **API’s and Services** tab from the left menu, and enable all the maps and places related services. In case of confusion, you can enable all for testing purposes.

![API’s and Services](/src/assets/doc-images/APIsAndServices.png)

5. Next, go to **Keys and Credentials**, and create an Api Key.

![KeysAndCredentials](/src/assets/doc-images/KeysAndCredentials.png)

6. Once created, open its detailed view and we need to add some restrictions.

![DetailedView](/src/assets/doc-images/DetailedView.png)

7. In **Set an application restriction** section, select **Websites** option and add the domains you need to allow. You will only need to add localhost for your local development.

![AppRestriction](/src/assets/doc-images/AppRestriction.png)

8. Finally add this api key to the project’s **environment file** by the name **googleMapsApiKey**.

```
googleMapsApiKey: 'Your_Key_Here',
```

### Docker 🚢

**Dine-A-Night**’s Frontend has also been [Dockerized](https://medium.com/@swalperen3008/what-is-dockerize-and-dockerize-your-project-a-step-by-step-guide-899c48a34df6) so new users can quickly spin up local containers without even knowing a single thing about the project’s tech stack.
The following files were written for this purpose:

1. Dockerfile
2. .dockerignore
3. docker-compose.yml

You can check [this Pull Request](https://github.com/Dine-A-Night/dine-a-night_ui/pull/113) for more details.

All you need to do is execute the following command:

```
docker compose up --detach
```

which will start building the image…

![Building Docker Image](/src/assets/doc-images/image-1.png)

and spin a local container running that image in [daemonized state](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-start-a-docker-container-as-daemon-process)…

![Containers are spinned](/src/assets/doc-images/image-2.png)

which is basically the bundled web application being served by Nginx [Web Server](https://www.nginx.com/).

![Containers Log](/src/assets/doc-images/image-3.png)

**Nginx** is a production grade server that will run your application with all the optimizations applied. However, this is only meant for playing around with the application since any changes you make to your code would not restart the server.

One advantage of using docker containers is that once your image is built, you don’t have to go through the long build process every time, and the containers spin up nearly instantly.

![Home Page](/src/assets/doc-images/image-4.png)

Once you are done testing with the application, you can use the following command to **tear down** the running container(s).

```
docker compose down
```
